Flask Static Site Skeleton
================================

This code is meant to be a starting point for creating static sites that can be selectively edited by clients, in WYSIWYG fashion.

How to get started
--------------------

1. Clone repository to empty directory:

        git clone

2. Initialize your virtual environment, then activate it; for example in Ubuntu:

        virtualenv venv
        source venv/bin/activate

3. Install requirements with pip:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Begin developing your clients editable static site!

Developing the site
--------------------

You'll need to set up models for the content that you wish to allow the client to edit.
